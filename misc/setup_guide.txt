after cloning the repo, do these steps:

This is for windows:
1) Install system prereqs
A. Visual Studio Build Tools
Download and install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019 (or 2022) from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.
During install, select “Desktop development with C++”.
B. CMake
Download the Windows installer from https://cmake.org/download/.
Check “Add CMake to the system PATH” during install.
Verify in a new terminal:
cmake --version
C. Download python 3.9 and make sure to create your .venv with it

2) Install & Configure vcpkg
In your powershell terminal:

cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\vcpkg
cd C:\vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Install SDL2 and Boost (and other deps) in your powershell:
.\vcpkg.exe install sdl2 sdl2-image sdl2-ttf sdl2-gfx boost

Set environment variables for this session in your powershell:
set VCPKG_ROOT=C:\vcpkg
set CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
(If you want them permanently, add them in System → Environment Variables.)

3) Create a virtual environment

From your project root powershell terminal (i did not do this from my terminal, I used set environment fucntionaliy of dataspell):
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

4) Install python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel psutil

5. Build & Install the gfootball Engine
Load the VS compiler environment in the same terminal:
powershell
cmd /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64"
(This drops you into a CMD prompt with the right paths.)

Back in your project folder (in that CMD prompt):
cd C:\Users\<YourName>\Projects\AI-Projects\COMP\GoogleFootball-C+HRL
pip install --no-cache-dir gfootball

Verify by running:
python -m gfootball.play_game --action_set=full
You should see a window pop up and be able to play.

6) Fix the SDL Downgrade (if you get the Dynamic linking causes SDL downgrade! (compiled with 2.28.4, linked to 2.0.16) issue)
overwrite the existing SDL2.dll in the GoogleFootball-C+HRL\.venv\Lib\site-packages\gfootball_engine folder
with the SDL2.dll file from main folder

try again:
python -m gfootball.play_game --action_set=full
